# Neural-Networks-base-template
A base template for systems which are using Neural Networks for implementing machine learning's abilities.
I have built that project cecause I was needed a base for all my Deep Learning projects which the DNN is build from scratch.
The project is use only the NumPy libarary and onother utilities libs(matplotlib, pandas, etc.) but nor any ML framework because everything has built from scratch.
